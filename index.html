<div class="About">
  <h2>About me</h2>
  <br>
  <p>I was born in Nepal but spent a greater part of my growing days in India where I received my formal high school
  education. I moved to the UK with my family in 2007. I received my Bachelor's in Computer Graphic Technology from
  Kingston University.
  <br><br>
  With 5+ years of experience in the design industry, I have honed my skills in UX and UI design, with a focus on
  investigating and mapping out user needs and pains to create simple and seamless solutions. I have worked in highly
  collaborative environments with cross-disciplinary teams of engineers and QA's, taking ownership of projects from start
  to end.
  <br><br>
  I am passionate about creating products that make people's lives easier and more enjoyable. I am also a strong believer
  in the power of collaboration and teamwork to achieve great things.

 <h2>Work experience</h2>
 <br>
 <h3>Preqin - Product Designer (Jul 2020 ‚Äì present)</h3>
 <br>
 <p>
I am currently working as a Senior Product Designer at Preqin, where I am helping to build a SaaS platform to help
General Partners with their fundraising workflow. In addition to my design projects, I also work closely with the
product and design leadership team to develop the vision for our product and provide mentorship to junior and mid-level
designers on the team.
 </p>

<div class="Work2">
 <h3>Reed.co.uk - Product Designer (Jan ‚Äì Apr 2020)</h3>
 <br>
 <p>During my short time at Reed.co.uk, I was part of the team that focused on improving ‚ÄúPost-a-job‚Äù user journey for the
 ‚Äúdirect recruiter‚Äù tier customers. For this project, I worked with the Project Manager, Back-end/Front-end Engineers,
 and Scrum Master.
 <br><br>
 After analyzing existing user research data and current user experience, I highlighted the top three factors that would
 provide a better user experience and clear communication of the product that they are purchasing. Based on my discovery,
 I designed a guided ‚Äúpost-a-job‚Äù experience to help new users improve the quality of the job advert. In the new design,
 we communicate the benefits of posting a job advert with Reed to increase the direct recruiter conversion.
 </p>

<div class="Work3">
 <h3>Foundry - Product Designer (Jul 2018 ‚Äì Dec 2019)</h3>
 <br>
 <p>At Foundry, I worked on multiple new features and design library for Nuke Studio and Hiero 12.1 (released on 01/2020).
 <br><br>
 Since it is a software company most of my project required investigating third-party API and competitive analysis. After
 my investigation, I worked closely with the Product Manager and Senior Engineer to design a prototype to meet the
 feature requirements without any technical limitation when it goes to the development stage. I worked on the project
 with the Engineering and QA team until it was bug-free and ready for release.
 </p>
</div>

<div class="Work4">
 <h3>Homeshift - Product Designer Intern (Mar ‚Äì Jun 2018)</h3>
 <br>
 <p>My main focus at Homeshift was to create a new user journey and design to help new inheriting customers signup to
 Homeshift efficiently. For this project, I started the discovery by mapping the current user journey and conducting user
 interviews. After analyzing the research data, I designed a communication solution that was simple and effective for our
 customers.
