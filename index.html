<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I was born in Nepal but spent a greater part of my growing days in India where I received my formal high school
education. I moved to the UK with my family in 2007. I received my Bachelor's in Computer Graphic Technology from
Kingston University.
<br><br>
My experience lies in investigating and mapping out the needs and pains of a user to design a simple and seamless
solution. I have worked in highly collaborative environments with cross-disciplinary teams of engineers and QA's taking
ownership of the project from start to end.
<br><br>
I’m currently working as a Product Designer at Preqin to help build a SaaS platform to help General Partners with
Fundraising workflow.</p>



<h1>Process</h1>

 <li> <strong>Discovery</strong> work with internal stakeholders and Product team to get better insights into business goals and understand
 the user's needs.</li>
 <br>
 <li><strong>Define</strong> how we can help out the user by reviewing quantitative and qualitative research data.</li>
 <br>
 <li><strong>Ideation</strong> process to generate different ideas to solve the user's problem and add value to the product.</li>
 <br>

</ul>

 <h1>Work experience</h1>
 <h2>Preqin - Product Designer (July 2020 – Present)</h2>
 <p>At Preqin, I am working in a GP (General Partner) team to improve our Pro Platform user experience and reduce customer
churn.
<br><br>
As a Product Designer, I lead the project discovery, solution, design, and delivery phase based on the problem
statements provided by Product Owners. During all the phases of the project, I work very closely with Senior
Stakeholders, Product Managers, Engineers, and QA. I run workshops for ideation and feature prioritization to share and
align our decisions as a team.</p>

 <h3>Reed.co.uk - Product Designer (Jan – Apr 2020)</h3>
 <p>During my short time at Reed.co.uk, I was part of the team that focused on improving “Post-a-job” user journey for the
 “direct recruiter” tier customers. For this project, I worked with the Project Manager, Back-end/Front-end Engineers,
 and Scrum Master.
 <br><br>
 After analyzing existing user research data and current user experience, I highlighted the top three factors that would
 provide a better user experience and clear communication of the product that they are purchasing. Based on my discovery,
 I designed a guided “post-a-job” experience to help new users improve the quality of the job advert. In the new design,
 we communicate the benefits of posting a job advert with Reed to increase the direct recruiter conversion.</p>

 <h3>Foundry - Product Designer (Jul 2018 – Dec 2019)</h3>
 <p>At Foundry, I worked on multiple new features and design library for Nuke Studio and Hiero 12.1 (released on 1st Jan 2020).
 <br><br>
 Since it is a software company most of my project required investigating third-party API and competitive analysis. After
 my investigation, I worked closely with the Product Manager and Senior Engineer to design a prototype to meet the
 feature requirements without any technical limitation when it goes to the development stage. I worked on the project
 with the Engineering and QA team until it was bug-free and ready for release.</p>

  <h3>Homeshift - Product Designer Intern (Mar – Jun 2018)</h3>
  <p>My main focus at Homeshift was to create a new user journey and design to help new inheriting customers signup to
  Homeshift efficiently. For this project, I started the discovery by mapping the current user journey and conducting user
  interviews. After analyzing the research data, I designed a communication solution that was simple and effective for our
  customers.</p>
