<div class="About">
  <h2>About me</h2>
  <br>
  <p>I am from Nepal but spent most of my formative years in Darjeeling India, where I completed my high school education. In 2007,
  I relocated to the UK and completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Graphic Technology from Kingston University.
  <br><br>
  With 5+ years of experience in the design industry, I have honed my skills in UX and UI design, with a focus on
  investigating and mapping out user needs and pains to create simple and seamless solutions. I have worked in highly
  collaborative environments with cross-disciplinary teams of engineers and QA's, taking ownership of projects from start
  to end.
  <br><br>
  I am passionate about creating products that make people's lives easier and more enjoyable. I am also a strong believer
  in the power of collaboration and teamwork to achieve great things.

 <h2>Work experience</h2>
 <br>
 <h3>Preqin - Product Designer (Jul 2020 â€“ present)</h3>
 <br>
 <p>
I am currently working as a Senior Product Designer at Preqin, where I am helping to build a SaaS platform to help
General Partners with their fundraising workflow. In addition to my design projects, I also work closely with the
product and design leadership team to develop the vision for our product and provide mentorship to junior and mid-level
designers on the team.
 </p>

<div class="Work2">
 <h3>Reed.co.uk - Product Designer (Jan â€“ Apr 2020)</h3>
 <br>
 <p>As part of a team dedicated to enhancing the user experience for Reed.co.uk's "direct recruiter" tier customers, I
contributed to the improvement of the "post-a-job" journey. Collaborating with the Project Manager, Back-end/Front-end
Engineers, and Scrum Master, I delved into existing user research data and analyzed the current user experience.
 <br><br>
Through this meticulous examination, I identified three key factors that would significantly enhance the user experience
and ensure clear communication of the product being offered. Based on these findings, I designed a guided "post-a-job"
experience that assists new users in crafting high-quality job adverts. This redesigned experience also effectively
conveys the benefits of posting a job advert with Reed, thereby increasing the likelihood of direct recruiter
conversion.

<div class="Work3">
 <h3>Foundry - Product Designer (Jul 2018 â€“ Dec 2019)</h3>
 <br>
 <p>At Foundry, I was responsible for the development of multiple
  new features and the design library for Nuke Studio and Hiero 12.1. These projects were released in January 2020.
 <br><br>
Due to the nature of the software industry, most of my projects required in-depth research into third-party APIs and competitive analysis. Once I had a thorough understanding of the market, I would work closely with the Product Manager and Senior Engineer to design a prototype that met the feature requirements without introducing any technical limitations during the development stage. I would then work with the Engineering and QA teams to ensure that the project was bug-free and ready for release. I take pride in my ability to deliver high-quality software that meets the needs of users.
 </p>

<div class="Work4">
 <h3>Homeshift - Product Designer Intern (Mar â€“ Jun 2018)</h3>
 <br>
 <p>At Homeshift, I was tasked with streamlining the signup process for inheriting customers. To achieve this, I embarked on a journey of discovery, meticulously mapping the existing user journey and conducting in-depth interviews with customers. Armed with valuable insights from these research initiatives, I crafted a communication solution that was both simple and effective, ensuring a seamless and hassle-free signup experience for our valued customers.
 </p>
</div>

<div class="Process">
  <h2>My process</h2>
  <ol>
    <li></strong><strong>Discovery:</strong> I work closely with internal stakeholders and the product team to understand business goals and user needs. I also conduct user research to gather quantitative and qualitative data about user pain points, goals, and behaviors. I then analyze this data to identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Define:</strong> Once I have a good understanding of the business goals and user needs, I define the problem we are trying to solve and the user we are designing for. I develop a user persona and user journey to better understand the user's needs and experience. I then define the product's vision, goals, and features.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Ideation:</strong> Next, I ideate / run worshops to brainstorm a variety of solutions to the problem we are trying to solve. I consider different user needs, business goals, and technical constraints. I also sketch and prototype ideas to visualize and test different concepts.</li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>Develop:</strong> Once I have a promising concept, I create high-fidelity wireframes and prototypes to test and refine the design. I conduct user testing to get feedback on the design and identify areas for improvement. I then make design iterations based on user feedback.</li>
  </ol>
