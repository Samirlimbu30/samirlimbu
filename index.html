 <h1>About me</h1>
<p>I was born in Nepal but spent a greater part of my growing days in India where I received my formal high school
education. I moved to the UK with my family in 2007. I received my Bachelor's in Computer Graphic Technology from
Kingston University.

My experience lies in investigating and mapping out the needs and pains of a user to design a simple and seamless
solution. I have worked in highly collaborative environments with cross-disciplinary teams of engineers and QA's taking
ownership of the project from start to end.

I’m currently working as a Product Designer at Preqin to help build a SaaS platform to help General Partners with
Fundraising workflow.</p>

 <h1>Work experience</h1>
 <h2>Preqin - Product Designer (July 2020 – Present)</h2>
 <p>During my short time at Reed.co.uk, I was part of the team that focused on improving “Post-a-job” user journey for the
 “direct recruiter” tier customers. For this project, I worked with the Project Manager, Back-end/Front-end Engineers,
 and Scrum Master.
 
 After analyzing existing user research data and current user experience, I highlighted the top three factors that would
 provide a better user experience and clear communication of the product that they are purchasing. Based on my discovery,
 I designed a guided “post-a-job” experience to help new users improve the quality of the job advert. In the new design,
 we communicate the benefits of posting a job advert with Reed to increase the direct recruiter conversion.</p>

 <h2>Foundry - Product Designer (Jul 2018 – Dec 2019)</h2>
 <p>At Foundry, I worked on multiple new features and design library for Nuke Studio and Hiero 12.1 (released on 01/2020).
 
 Since it is a software company most of my project required investigating third-party API and competitive analysis. After
 my investigation, I worked closely with the Product Manager and Senior Engineer to design a prototype to meet the
 feature requirements without any technical limitation when it goes to the development stage. I worked on the project
 with the Engineering and QA team until it was bug-free and ready for release.</p>

  <h2>Homeshift - Product Designer Intern (Mar – Jun 2018)</h2>
  <p>My main focus at Homeshift was to create a new user journey and design to help new inheriting customers signup to
  Homeshift efficiently. For this project, I started the discovery by mapping the current user journey and conducting user
  interviews. After analyzing the research data, I designed a communication solution that was simple and effective for our
  customers.</p>
