 <h2>Work experience</h2>
 <br>
 <h3>Preqin - Product Designer (Jul 2020 ‚Äì present)</h3>
 <br>
 <p>At Preqin, I am working in a GP (General Partner) team to improve our Pro Platform user experience and reduce customer
 churn.
 <br><br>
 As a Product Designer, I lead the project discovery, solution, design, and delivery phase based on the problem
 statements provided by Product Owners. During all the phases of the project, I work very closely with Senior
 Stakeholders, Product Managers, Engineers, and QA. I run workshops for ideation and feature prioritization to share and
 align our decisions as a team.
 <br><br>
I also provide some mentoring and guidance to new and junior designers at Preqin.

 <h3>Reed.co.uk - Product Designer (Jan ‚Äì Apr 2020)</h3>
 <br>
 <p>During my short time at Reed.co.uk, I was part of the team that focused on improving ‚ÄúPost-a-job‚Äù user journey for the
 ‚Äúdirect recruiter‚Äù tier customers. For this project, I worked with the Project Manager, Back-end/Front-end Engineers,
 and Scrum Master.
 <br><br>
 After analyzing existing user research data and current user experience, I highlighted the top three factors that would
 provide a better user experience and clear communication of the product that they are purchasing. Based on my discovery,
 I designed a guided ‚Äúpost-a-job‚Äù experience to help new users improve the quality of the job advert. In the new design,
 we communicate the benefits of posting a job advert with Reed to increase the direct recruiter conversion.
 </p>

<div class="Work3">
 <h3>Foundry - Product Designer (Jul 2018 ‚Äì Dec 2019)</h3>
 <br>
 <p>At Foundry, I worked on multiple new features and design library for Nuke Studio and Hiero 12.1 (released on 01/2020).
 <br><br>
 Since it is a software company most of my project required investigating third-party API and competitive analysis. After
 my investigation, I worked closely with the Product Manager and Senior Engineer to design a prototype to meet the
 feature requirements without any technical limitation when it goes to the development stage. I worked on the project
 with the Engineering and QA team until it was bug-free and ready for release.
 </p>
</div>

<div class="Work4">
 <h3>Homeshift - Product Designer Intern (Mar ‚Äì Jun 2018)</h3>
 <br>
 <p>My main focus at Homeshift was to create a new user journey and design to help new inheriting customers signup to
 Homeshift efficiently. For this project, I started the discovery by mapping the current user journey and conducting user
 interviews. After analyzing the research data, I designed a communication solution that was simple and effective for our
 customers.
